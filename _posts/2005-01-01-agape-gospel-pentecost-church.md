I am an overseer of more than 30 churches, 26 pastors and three senior pastors under the leadership of our presiding
Bishop in Blantyre, Malawi, with churches in all three regions of Malawi and into Mozambique. My ministry also crosses
over to other denominations with conferences and teachings.

I want to recommend you both for ministry because our close
fellowship and working together has had great impact on our Churches in Malawi. I and my wife (Eulfe), we highly welcome
and appreciate your coming to Malawi over a number of years.Your ministry of the Word to us, out Pastors, leaders and
Christians, who have attended and received your teachings, have made a great change in our families, Ministries, and
Churches. I am one of the many leaders who have greatly benefited from your teachings on the Christian family, the Holy
Spirit and the ministry gifts.

Your co-workers in the Lord
Rev. Maxwell and Elufe Chimwaza, Overseers
