I, on behalf of our pastors and churches in Malawi and Mozambique would like to thank the Lord for your Ministry. We
would like to assure you that the conferences and seminars which you and Emily have had were very successful ones, and
your coming has been a testimony of it's own.

We really thank you for teaching us the truth of the Word of God which you
unfolded through your anointed teaching gift which lifted us up from faith to faith. the fruits have been seen by us and
also our churches that now we are able to witness your teachings through our lives.

Bishop Cedric Whaya, Presiding Bishop and Founder
Church on the Rock, Malawi
