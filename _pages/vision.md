Duane and Emily have a vision to minister and to build up the Body of Christ through preaching and teaching of the Word
with signs and wonders and the sharing of the Prophetic Voice to nations in South and Central Africa, Central and
South America and anywhere else the Lord directs.

Duane received a prophecy from Evangelist, Dick Mills in 1978, Exodus 4:11 "Open your mouth and I will fill it". It was
some years later that he and his wife understood this Word. The Lord spoke to them in 1996 that they would be going to
the out of the way places and be starting "brush fires" for Him. The word was confirmed several times. They are
fulfilling those words as they have been sent into the byways of South and Central African nations.

They work trans-denominationally in the Body of Christ by encouraging leadership and teaching the Gospel [the almost too
good to be true good news] with signs and wonders following. They desire to see the captives set free and to see
believers live in victory using the authority they have in Christ Jesus.
